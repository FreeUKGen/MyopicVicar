In this Table the Register Type can be: PR is from a Parish Register; AT is from an Archdeacon's Transcript; BT is from a Bishop's Transcript; TR is from a transcript of the Parish Registers; PH is from a Phillimore Transcript of a Parish Register; EX is from a selective extract of the Parish Register; DW is from a Dwelly's Transcript of a Parish register; and if there is no entry our transcription is from an unspecified document but is <b>most likely</b> transcribed from a Parish Register. The Source is where FreeREG obtained the documents/images that were transcribed. Notes are additional comments made about the Register. The date given in the Record last amended column is the most recent date that a record in the register was entered or amended in the database.
