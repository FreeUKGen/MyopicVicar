<p> The database contents pages contain a wealth of information about what the database contains for each and every register we have transcribed. They contain far more detail and accurate information than available in the first version of FreeREG, including the number of transcription records for each decade. If you want to know more about the contents or in doubt about how to use these pages please read our <a href="<%=Rails.application.config.website%>/help">HELP</a> notes.</p>
