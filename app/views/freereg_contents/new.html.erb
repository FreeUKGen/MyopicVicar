    <p>You will find a wealth of information in these pages about each County, Place, Church and Register that has records in the database: everything from a detailed county listing right down to how many records the database holds for every ten-year period of an individual register.</p>
    <p> There are two ways of accessing information. Go straight to a place that interests you by highlighting the place name from the list of places; or to explore the county do not highlight a place name from the list of places (For counties with more than 500,000 records you will have select the first letter of a place) and then follow the links.</p>
