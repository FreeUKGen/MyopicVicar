<p style="text-align: center"><b>Welcome to the FreeREG Registration process.</b></p>
<p>Through this process you may register with FreeREG either as a <b>researcher</b>, as a <b>transcriber</b>, or express a willingness to join FreeREG in a <b>technical</b> capacity. </p>


<p>As a <b>researcher</b> you will have access to a number of capabilities not generally available to the general public including the ability to save searches and to be notified when additional records are added to places of interest to you.</p>


<p>As a <b>transcriber</b> you can register to join a syndicate of transcribers focused on a specific area or time frame in which case the Syndicate Coordinator will get in touch with you to asssign you work and do any required training. If you are uncertain you can still register and have our volunteer coordinator discuss with you your interests in transcibing and have them assign you to the best fit. In which case select the General syndicate when selecting a syndicate.</p>


<p>If you express an interest in joining the <b>technical</b> team then a member of the executive will get in touch with you to see how you may be able to contribute. We are specifically interested in people with experience in Rails/Ruby technology and html/css coding.</p>
