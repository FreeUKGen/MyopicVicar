  <p class="read-length">You may need to recast your search options: see our <%= link_to "Search Tips", "/cms/help", :title => "Help" %> for advice on how to get the most out of your searches.<br>
    Alternatively you were searching for entries that simply do not exist in our database because: We have yet to transcribe the registers; there are gaps in the registers or they no longer exist; the transcriptions are subject to an embargo on their publication; we do not have the financial resources to purchase the registers; or Record Offices will not permit us to acquire copies of the registers. <br>
    Our <%= link_to "Transcription", "/freereg_contents/new?locale=en", :title => "Transcriptions" %> pages can tell you what we have transcribed and the periods of their availability. They also contain lists of the actual names that appear in a register so that you may consider alternative spellings.</p>
