    <h2>The FreeBMD database</h2>
    <p>Here are some points to bear in mind about the FreeBMD database:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>FreeBMD covers England and Wales only, not Scotland, Ireland or overseas.</li>
        <li>The more detail you put in the search, the fewer results you will get. (Put in too much detail and you may get none!). The less detail you put in, the more results you get. The search will not show more than 3000 results.</li>
        <li>The start date is 1837 and the end date 1999, but the data is not complete after 1992.</li>
        <li>Each year was divided into quarters until 1984 – January February March, April May June, July August September, October November December.</li>
        <li>Events are recorded when they were registered, which may have been weeks or sometimes months after they happened. Registration started on 1st July 1837, September quarter.</li>
        <li>Narrow your search by choosing start and end dates, single forename, and limiting searches to one county or one district.</li>
        <li>Ages at death are only shown from 1866. Mother’s maiden name for births are shown from September quarter 1911. Spouse surnames for marriages are shown from 1912.
            Dates of births are shown in death entries from June quarter 1969.</li>
        <li>There is more detailed help available to get successful search results.</li>
    </ol>
