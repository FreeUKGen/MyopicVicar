    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>All links on the site open in the same browser tab that you are currently using. This improves the accessibility of the site. If you
    want to follow a link to an external site (e.g. the <a href="https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/login.asp">GRO site</a>
        or <a href="https://www.ukbmd.org.uk/reg/districts/index.html">UKBMD</a>), you might want to open it in a new tab or window. This will avoid the need to use the 'back' button to get back to where you were
        in the FreeBMD web site (see next tip).</p>
    <p>Browsers offer different ways of achieving this, but for example in Windows you can right-click on the link and use the 'Open Link in
        New Tab' or 'Open Link in New Window' command. </p>
    <h3>Avoid the 'back' button</h3>
    <p>We always provide links that enable you to go back to the page you were on previously. For example, after you have run a search,
    you may want to revise your search or start a new one. There are 'Revise Search' and 'New Search' links which allow you to do this.
    It is a good idea always to use the links provided, rather than using the browser's 'back' button. Pressing 'back' can leave you in
    a situation where the site thinks it is still running your previous search. This would prevent you from doing anything else.</p>
