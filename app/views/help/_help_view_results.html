<ul><li><b>First Name &amp;amp; Surname</b> of the individual</li>
<li><b>Record Type</b>: Birth, Marriage, or Death.</li>
<li><b>Registration Date</b>: the quarter or year the event was registered. For records before 1984, the results show the quarter (e.g., March, June, September, December). After 1984, it will only show the year.</li>
