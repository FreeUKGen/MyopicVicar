<li><b>Download as GEDCOM</b>. GEDCOM is a file format for exchanging genealogical data between different systems. GEDCOM allows you to export your genealogy data from one application, and then import it into another.</li>
<li><b>Citing your findings</b>. If you are going to share the information you find in a family tree or biography, in a way that lets you or other researchers check your work, you can cite your finding with the information you send to the G.R.O. for the certificate, the place you found it (www.freebmd.org.uk) and the date you made the search. We make this easier for you, by providing a Generate Citation button which generates the text in a format of your choice, ready for you to copy-and-paste. You can find more information about using citations in family history and academia in the citations section of our About page. </li>
<li><b>Social media or private sharing</b>. You are welcome to capture a snippet of what you have found, and share that on social media or privately. Please let others know that it comes from www.freebmd.org.uk â€” we want more people to know that we exist!</li></ul>
