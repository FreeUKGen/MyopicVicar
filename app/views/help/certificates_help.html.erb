      <h2>Order a certificate</h2>

      <p>To order a certificate from the G.R.O., follow these steps:<p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Access Entry information page</b><br/>
          On the Search Results page, click on the name in the first column in the record youâ€™re interested in to go to the Entry information page.</li>

        <li><b>Note key details</b><br/>
          On the Entry information page, make a note of the following details: name, quarter (or month) and year of registration, district, volume and page numbers. These details are required when ordering a certificate.</li>

        <li><b>Verify with original index</b> (if available)<br/>
          If the camera icon appears in the "More Information" table row, click it to view an image of the original index (if available). This will allow you to verify the accuracy of the transcription.</li>

        <li><b>Check for notes (Postems)</b><br/>
          Before ordering the certificate, click the envelope icon to check for Postems. Other FreeBMD users may have left helpful notes regarding the information on the certificate, which could save you the cost of ordering a certificate.</li>

        <li><b>Order a certificate</b><br/>
          Once you're ready to order, go to the <a href="https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/indexes_search.asp">G.R.O. ordering page</a>. This is where you can place the order for the certificate.</li></ol>
