<p> Too large a file </p>

<p>The member <%= @user.userid %> submitted an action for a file <%= @file %> that was too large for normal processing. They were informed that it was being held for review. <br></p>
<p>If this was an initial upload then the file should be split into parts and the parts uploaded separately. If it is a replacement or a deletion then develop a plan for its processing.</p>

<p>This email was sent to the syndicate coordinator and data managers. The coordinator is requested to consult with the data managers if they are unsure as to how to proceed.</p>
<% else%>
<p>Would one of the data managers please review this with the member as it appears they have no coordinator.</p>
