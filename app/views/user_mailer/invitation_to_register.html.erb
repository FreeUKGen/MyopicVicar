<p> Dear <%= @user.person_forename %>;</p>
<p>Welcome. </p>

<p>Your coordinator has invited you to register as a transcriber for FreeREG with a userid of <b><%= @user.userid %>.</b> You need to follow the link below or paste a copy into your browser address window to reset your password to something only you know.
</p>

<p><a href="<%=Rails.application.config.website%>/refinery/users/password/edit?initial=true&reset_password_token=<%= @user_token %>"> <%=Rails.application.config.website%>/refinery/users/password/edit?initial=true&reset_password_token=<%= @user_token %> </a></p>

<p> After setting the password you will be able to log into the server and access transcriber tools for FreeREG for the first time.

<p> <b>Go to the following link to login to the server. </b> We suggect you bookmark (save into favourites) this page</p>

<p> <a href="<%=Rails.application.config.website%>/refinery/users/login"> <%=Rails.application.config.website%>/refinery/users/login</a></p>

<p> Do not reply to this email but instead contact your coordinator who has been informed of your registration.</p>

<% unless @coordinator.nil? %>

<p> <%= @coordinator.person_forename %>  <%= @coordinator.person_surname %> at <%= @coordinator.email_address%></p>
<%end%>
