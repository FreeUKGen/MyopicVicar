I have sent this OFF list to all due to the size.  (Split in to 2 emails Devon will follow)

 

Here are more images as requested. This time it is the 1851.

 

I have named them how they would appear on the CD that the images come on at present.

I have chosen 2 Counties to use in these examples so you can see the difference in quality.

 

CIVIL PARISH AND ED NUMBER

 

Both sets start with the ED page where the Transcriber will pick up the Civil Parish Name and the ED Number.

 

FOLIO NUMBERS

 

You will notice that they also have a FOLIO Number.

The Folio number changes every other page.

Think of the Images in the Enumerators Book.

Open the book and you will see 2 pages, Left and right.  (the Right hand page or most books start with page number 1)

So when the Enumerator stamped the Books with the folio number,  he did so on the top right hand corner of each Book.

The FOLIO Number then related to that page and the following page that would be on the back of the right hand page.

The whole of the PIECE NUMBER would then be stamped likewise, including all INFORMATION PAGES etc. starting with Folio 1.

Some Counties are larger than others and can include more than one Book, but the Folios should! still follow on from one book to another.

 

SCHEDULE NUMBERS

When you look at the images you will see that EACH household has a number in the first column (left hand side) for the first member of the household. (Normally the HEAD)

This number is what we refer to as the SCHEDULE NUMBER.

This SCHEDULE number links all the household together. It is therefore VERY IMPORTANT, as without it the household would all be scattered.

 

TUTORIALS

 

I have also attached the tutorial documents.

These will help you to see where the DATA comes from off of the IMAGES,  that  in turn enables the TRANSCRIBER to enter it on to the CSV.

 

These instructions apply to the other census years up to 1891.

 

When I get to 1901 and  1911 they are slightly different but will deal with them later.

 

Will send the 1861 Census images next.
