MyopicVicar is an open-source genealogical record database and search engine.  It is the 
software that powers the [FreeREG](https://www.freereg.org.uk) database of parish register 
entries and the [FreeCEN](https://freecen2.freecen.org.uk) database of UK census records.

The tool has been developed by [Free UK Genealogy](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/), a 
registered charity dedicated to making genealogical information freely available online.
It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

# We Need You!
Volunteers are essential to every part of the project. We welcome contributions to the 
software, documentation, and to the records themselves.

Getting involved with helping out is simple; have a go at something on our waffle boards with a ‘Good First Issue’ label. Visit <a href="https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/about/volunteer/tech-volunteering-opportunities/good-first-issue-volunteer">our website</a> for more information.

# Architecture

Myopic Vicar uses MongoDB to allow researchers to search heterogeneous records.  Both FreeREG and FreeCEN projects accept volunteer contributions as spreadsheets, while metadata, quality control and coordination provided by volunteer coordinators and data managers.
