MyopicVicar is an open-source genealogical record database and search engine.  It is the 
software that hosts the [FreeREG](https://www.freereg.org.uk) database of parish register 
entries and the [FreeCEN](https://freecen2.freecen.org.uk) database of UK census records.

The tool has been developed by [Free UK Genealogy](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/), a 
registered charity dedicated to making genealogical information freely available online.

Volunteers are essential to every part of the project. We welcome contributions to the 
software, documentation, and to the records themselves.
