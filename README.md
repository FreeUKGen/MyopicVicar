MyopicVicar is an open-source genealogical record database and search engine.  It is the 
software that powers the [FreeREG](https://www.freereg.org.uk) database of parish register 
entries and the [FreeCEN](https://freecen2.freecen.org.uk) database of UK census records.

The tool has been developed by [Free UK Genealogy](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/), a 
registered charity dedicated to making genealogical information freely available online.
It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
