# Thank you for contributing.  This is a placeholder document while we develop our contribution guidelines.

Thank you for your interest in Free UK Genealogy and the MyopicVicar 
genealogical records database and search engine!

## Our Code of Conduct

Free UK Genealogy, including its software development team, operates 
under a [code of 
conduct](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/files/Documents/Code-of-Conduct.pdf).

The short version is, _Be excellent to each other_.  (See the full version at 
https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/files/Documents/Code-of-Conduct.pdf)

## How We Develop Software

Free UK Genealogy development operates on a modified Agile methodology, 
working in two-week sprints.  Technical teams developing MyopicVicar and 
related tools meet via a Google Hangout videoconference every two on 
Wednesday at 1530 GMT/1030 EST (FreeCEN) or 1630 GMT/1130 EST (FreeREG).  
Participants in this meeting review the previous sprint's work, discuss 
blocked issues, and schedule work for the next sprint.  Attendance at 
these meetings is not mandatory, but an email update from developers 
unable to attend is appreciated.

All development is tracked in Github issues, and organized and 
prioritized using Waffle.io, which provides a kanban-style interface.

* The [FreeREG Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/freeukgen/myopicvicar)
* The [FreeCEN Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/freeukgen/freecenmigration)



## How We Communicate

The Free UK Genealogy development team communicates through several channels.  

* A traditional mailing list allows developers and system administrators 
to discuss production issues and large-scale architectural changes.
* A Slack team provides more immediate communication among developers on 
different projects and supports occasional asynchronous discussion.
* Google Hangouts allow video and live-chat meetings.

In addition, several projects have Google Groups for discussion among 
volunteers transcribing records.

## How You Can Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Free UK Genealogy projects without 
developing a line of software.

### Transcribing Records

Each project needs volunteers to help transcribe records.  In addition 
to benefiting the needs of the projects, this provides a deep 
introduction to the project aims and the perspective of our users.

[Learn more about transcribing](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/about/volunteer/transcriber-volunteering-opportunities/)

### Product Research and Testing

Frequently, user-reported issues need specific reproduction steps and 
suggestions of correct behavior.  Attempting to reproduce, document, and 
define these issues is a valuable contribution to the project and also a 
great way to learn about the details of the tools and their users.

### Code

Projects also need developers to contribute code, whether that be bug 
fixes, data analysis, or new and improved features.

_We highly recommend that volunteer developers contact TODO to be 
partnered with a mentor.  This mentor can help answer questions and 
smooth over difficulties faced by people new to the codebase._

While some developers install a full Ruby on Rails/MongoDB/MySQL stack 
on their development machines, the easiest way to get up and running is 
to develop code in a virtual workspace provided by Cloud9.

1. Create a branch for your change off of `master` or (for FreeCEN-specific features) `freecen_parsing`
1. Develop and test your changes locally.
1. Push your changes to Github.
1. Create a pull request to merge your branch into `master` (or `freecen_parsing`).
1. Assign the pull request to your mentor to review and merge.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

BWB: replace with our CLA, encourage people to contact/ask mentors

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an 
    [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a 
    [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Contributions

To request a feature, report a bug, or suggest improvements to documentation for this repository:
* create an issue using the Github Issues tool
* if you would also like to contribute a fix, then create a pull request referencing that issue. 

Anyone with a github account may create an issue, but there are some constraints (see below) on who may contribute pull requests.

## Constraints on merging 

As with all projects in Islandora Labs, all contributors to a pull request must have an Islandora 
CLA ([Contributor License Agreement]) on file before it can be merged. 
Here, a contributor is defined as the author of a git commit.

In Islandora Labs, the policies for merging may be different from the standard [Islandora Committer's Workflow]. 
These policies are set at the discretion of the Current Maintainer, as defined in this project's README.md.

In this project, the following policies apply:
* Only maintainers of this module may merge pull requests.
* A person may *not* merge their own pull requests, nor a pull request that they have contributed code to.
* A formal review (using Github's Review feature) is *not* required.
* A pull request may be merged at any time after it is created.
* A person *may* merge code contributed by another employee of the same organization.

# How to contribute

I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/anselmh/CONTRIBUTING.md/issues) for your issue if there is no one yet.
	* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug.
	* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch. (e.g. `feature--autoplay` or `bugfix--ios-crash`)
	* Usually this is based on the master branch.
	* Create a branch based on master; `git branch
	fix/master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
	checkout fix/master/my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
* Make use of the `.editorconfig`-file if provided with the repository.
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

* If possible, submit tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch.
	_Advanced users may install the `hub` gem and use the [`hub pull-request` command](https://hub.github.com/hub.1.html)._
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please do not close the issue yourself_.
_Notice: You can [turn your previously filed issues into a pull-request here](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)._
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve.
