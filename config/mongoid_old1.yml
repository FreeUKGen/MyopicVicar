    # F2-specific notes:
    ################################
    # F2 uses two different Mongoid connections to MongoDB in order to
    # support scaling the system through spinning up several  search-only
    # app servers which run against replicas of the F2 data, while
    # administrative/coordinator/transcriber functions run against the
    # main F2 database.
    #
    # This means that two kinds of database configurations need to be
    # supported: search-only and admin
    #
    # Because searches write to the search_queries collection in order
    # to track performance, support pagination, etc. they need to connect
    # to a local, non-replicated mongodb instance to store that data, in
    # addition to connecting to a local mongodb instance that is part of
    # the replica set for R/O searche logic.
    #
    # By contrast, the admin features should write directly to the primary
    # MongoDB server connected to the replica set.  To reduce confusion,
    # they should also have a local MongoDB instance for their search_queries
    # collection
    #
    #####################
