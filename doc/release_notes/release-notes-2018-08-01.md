__FreeREG | Release Notes__
=======================
01-08-2018

__New Features__
----------------

* Flexible CSV record format - we have recently extended the number of fields in our database and made the order of these fields flexible.  Features include:
 * Many more fields are now available â€” information that you used to put in the Notes field is likely to have its own field
 * You can use as many (or as few) of the fields as you need
 * You can have the fields in whatever order works best for your register
 
 
 __Improvements__
 ----------------

 * Added the ability to select multiple submitted groups as complete for Syndicate Coordinators (similar functionality to be added later for Country Coordinators) (Issue 1484)


__Fixes__
---------

* Fixed an issue where render and/or redirect were being called multiple times in register (Issue 1493)
* Fixed an issue which triggered an 'undefined method' error for 'get_sorted_group_name' on ImageServer (Issue 1490)
* Fixed an issue caused by bots navigating past the login area triggering a nomethod error (Issue 1524)
