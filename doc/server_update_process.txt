Deployment of code to production:
Our production servers: basil, curry, fennel, ginseng, colobus

On each server in turn, replacing server name where appropriate
Step 1: on basil
Update FreeReg code:
cd  /home/apache/hosts/freereg2/production
copy any new configuration files to the server using Filezilla or equivalent ( Rarely required)
f2rake tmp:cache:clear # do occasionally (Once every quarter)
git status # just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freereg2

Step 2:
Update FreeCen code:
cd  /home/apache/hosts/freecen2/production
copy any new configuration files to the server using Filezilla or equivalent
f2rake tmp:cache:clear # do occasionally
git status #just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freecen2


Back to Step 1,2 repeat for next server

When complete update refinery

alias f2rake='sudo -u webserv bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production'


Update code in test servers:
To keep the test servers up-to-date with master we also need to update the test code base. This can be done after every production codebase update.
Test server: night
Environments: production and development
Production(staging) needs to in sync with latest master.
Updating staging code:
Step 1: Update FreeReg code
cd /home/apache/hosts/freereg2/production
git status #just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freereg2

Step 2: Update FreeCen code
cd /home/apache/hosts/freecen2/production
git status #just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freecen2

Updating development code:
Step 1: Update FreeReg code
cd /home/apache/hosts/freereg2/development
git status #just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freereg2-development
sudo -u webserv bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production assets:precompile
sudo touch tmp/restart.txt

Step 2: Update FreeCen code
cd /home/apache/hosts/freecen2/development
git status #just to make sure we are on master
git stash # to remove any local change (there should not be any)
sudo rm -R public/assets # only required when there is a restructuring of assets
sudo bash /root/bin/update-freecen2-development
sudo -u webserv bundle exec rake RAILS_ENV=production assets:precompile
sudo touch tmp/restart.txt
